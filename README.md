# AudioScope
Plot audio signals and frequencies in real time using python and matplotlib. This project is still early on, but this will be paired with a wide range of other utilities. A useful feature of this right now is the ability to adjuct the figure axes and scale as needed during the animation.  

## lan_scope
Essentially the same as oscilloscope.py but creates an UDP server and is intended to be used with this <a href="https://github.com/johnharakas/AudioLAN">AudioLAN</a> application. The server decodes datagram packets being streamed over LAN by an Android microphone.
